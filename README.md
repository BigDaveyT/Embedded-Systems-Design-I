# Embedded-Systems-Design-I

This is an embedded systems architecture and design course. Microprocessor, as well as system 
level design principles were analyzed from both a hardware and software perspective. 

Assembly language and C are used to develop software applications for a 32-bit embedded processor.

Application software emphasizes interrupt driven operation and peripheral interfacing.

A hardware description language (VHDL) is used to design and debug embedded components for an 
FPGA-based system.

Intended Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Design embedded systems using softcore processor
2.  Use version control to track changes and implement features
3.  Use I/O devices and peripherals
4.  Interface and size different memory devices
5.  Implement custom intellectual property cores
6.  Design and implement custom busses and interfaces protocols
7.  Properly constrain designs using timing analysis  
8.  Use benchmarking to measure hardware acceleration and design improvements
